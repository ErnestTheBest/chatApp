* When you search for contact and click on it, clear field and re-render all contacts list, with it selected

----- FANCY -----
* Sort contacts alphabetically(Comparator)
* Seemless message updates (not re-rendering all page)
* On search determine if contact is already favorite or not

----- DONE -----
* Mobile viewport should not include address bar (100vh -> 100%)
* When you click on mobile contact, menu should close
* Profile page update fetch
* Populate profile page with data. Readonly field with login
* Fix IDs. They can't start with number
* Refactor new messages service. Keep previous info
* Block writing to offline users
* Lock mechanism for input and form fields
* New messages mechanism from contacts only while online
* User statuses update service
* Online/Offline users mechanism
* Two digit time in messages
* Poll message updates in chat (create chackForNewMessages function)
* Poll pings
* Add remove-add contacts on button click
* On login load contacts list

----- FIXED -----
* Status launch fails at initial login. 
* If user keeps sending messages, user and circle is added multiple times.
* Due to 5 sec delay for new messages, if switched immidiately after new msg, indisator pops up
* Safari. Use event.target.parentNode instead of path
* Welcome to chatapp remove status
* Don't show your self in contacts (even after search)
* You are not sent back on name change
* Remove chat.html mock data
* Border on disabled button should be consistent colour with button
* Html, Body, Container 100% for mobile version

----- BUG -----
* If user chat is open and he goes offline, chat is not disabled
* Buttons must not move around. Align them to fixed positions.
